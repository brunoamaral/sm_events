The other day <a href="http://plus.google.com/+vascovasconcelos">+vasco vasconcelos</a> asked if I knew about upcoming events around social media / communication this year in Lisbon. Truth is, I have been so far away from events I didn't know what to tell him.</p>

<p>Instead of asking around and send him an email I had another idea. Why not #crowdsource  a list of social media events ?</p>

<p>A few minutes later I had a working version of this app, using a google form and some great javascript magic by <a href="http://jlord.us/">Jessica Lord.</a></p>

<p>There is a small bug that prevents people logged off from Google from seeing the table of events. I'll apply a fix as soon as I can find the time. In the meantime, if you see a blank page, login to gmail and go back to it. :) ï»¿</p>
